# F.I.S.H. App
This is an application made for a senior capstone project, developed in Expo and made for the Arizona Game & Fish Department. It's main purpose is to help the AZGFD collect more data on their fish populations, while creating an engaging experience for anglers. Anglers will be able to catch fish, scan them if they are tagged, and input the code (either using bluetooth or manually) into their phones. They will then be able to view data on the fish they have caught such as times caught, last length, and last location. They will update this information from their phones, and sync with our database when they reach an internet connection. More information on this project can be found [here](https://ceias.nau.edu/capstone/projects/CS/2022/TeamPhysh_F22/).
